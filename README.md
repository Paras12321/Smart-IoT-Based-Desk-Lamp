## ⚙️ Working Principle
- **Auto Mode:**  
  The lamp automatically turns ON/OFF based on motion detection and adjusts brightness adaptively.
  
- **Manual Mode:**  
  Users can control power, brightness, color, and lighting profiles manually.
  
- **Voice Mode (Limited):**  
  Basic voice commands are supported through the connected IoT platform.

Touch input and motion sensing provide additional interaction for seamless operation.
